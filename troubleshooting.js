    content: `<p>The device will alarm in two manners</p>
        <ol>
        <li>A pre-alarm which is quieter and illuminates the yellow status light above the display.  Pushing the OK button will acknowledge the alarm.</li>
        <li>An operating alarm, which is louder and the red status light will flash.</li>
        </ol>
    <p>In both types of alarms, the display will tell the user the reason for the alarm.</p>
    <p>A full description of the alarms is on pg. 58 of the instructions manual.</p>
    <p>The alarm volume can be set in the "Options" menu</p>

    title: "The syringe arm getting stuck out whilst powered down",
    content: "If the device is powered off without the syringe holder being returned to closed position, the arm will not retract.  Turning the device back on and closing the syringe holder will allow the user to then turn the device off again, and allow the device to retract the arm."
},
{
    title: "The syringe is not fitting correctly",
    content: "Ensure the device is not damaged, and that the syringe area is free of obstructions.  Most commonly, the reason for a syringe not seating correctly is because the wings of the syringe are not sitting to the left of the green syringe guide."

    title: "Pressure alarms",
    content: `<p>The Perfusor&reg; Space will alarm if the pressure is near or above the limit set by the user.  If the pressure is too low, it will also alarm.  Whilst some pressure changes are inevitable during an infusion, they can also alert clinicians to a problem with the infusion equipment.<p>
    <p>A "pressure drop detect" pre-alarm can alert users to a situation where a cannula has come free, or an infusion set has disconnected. A "pressure rise detect" or "pressure leap detect" can alert users to a situation where the infusion set has become kinked, a cannula has extravasated, or the venous flow is impeded by positioning, non-invasive blood pressure monitoring or oedema (e.g in circumferential burns).</p>

    title: "Battery maintenance",
    content: `
    <p>The device will periodically require battery maintenance.  This is a process where it will need to remain plugged in to the wall outlet for approximately 12 hours without use, as it fully discharges and slowly recharges its battery.  When this is due, the device will display “Battery Maintenance” after turning it off.  At a time that suits the user and expected operational needs, plug the device in and leave a note stating that battery maintenance is in progress, and the time and date it started.</p>
    <p>If operational demands do not allow this to occur, contact stores to make alternative arrangements.</p>
